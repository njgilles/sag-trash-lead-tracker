1. The checkmark that we have on the /maps page should be on the actual map ping and it should persist on the map to show where we have contacted people around the area without entering the zipcode 

2. There should be a solution here where the person is not interested and it should be an X instead of a check, this should be populated in the /contacted page also as not intereted at this time or something similar 

3. Editing the information should be very sleek and quick for people that are using the app

4. There should be a way to enter a lead manually that you have not found via the maps just to keep track of 

5. Create additional page with gcal capabilities to sync team on when we are meeting with leads / who they are and have common notes on lead
